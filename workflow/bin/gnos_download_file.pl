### setup / INSTALL
# mkdir /mnt/seqware-oozie/23f5253a-f33b-11e3-8add-8589c49f5d8e
# sudo apt-get install libcommon-sense-perl
# PURPOSE:
# the program takes a command (use single quotes to encapsulate it in bash) and
# a to check, the existance of which indidates the gtdownload finished running.
# It also takes a retries count, timeout for no data being written in minutes, and a
# cooldown (sleep) time in minutes for checking if the output exists. It then executes the command in a thread and
# watches the files every sleep time. For every timeout period where there is no
# change in the output file size then the retries count is
# decremented. By default, the retries are 30 and timeout 60 minutes so the code
# could retry a download that times out a total of 30 hours before giving up.
# If the retries are exhausted the thread is killed, the
# thread is recreated and started, and the process starts over.

# where file is the GNOS id of the file
